# Prowl - Product Backlog

## High Priority

{PROWL-010} **LEGAL-001: Trademark Clearance for "Prowl" Brand**
   The word "Prowl" has existing trademark registrations in adjacent software classes. While the goods/services are substantially different from QA testing, professional clearance is recommended before investing heavily in the brand.

**Existing registrations found**:
- **Oris Intel, LLC** — "PROWL" in Class 42 (SaaS software) for price monitoring, reseller identification, and policy enforcement tools (Reg. 4880040, registered 2016-01-05). Closest concern — same trademark class, but very different goods.
- **Camgian Microsystems Corp.** — "PROWL" in Class 9 for radar/tracking software (Reg. 4471189). Different goods and market.
- **Prowl iOS app** (prowlapp.com) — Push notification client operating since 2009. Common-law trademark rights in developer-adjacent space.
- **"prowl"** — No existing conflicts found.
- **"Prowl"** — No existing conflicts found. "QA" adds differentiation.

**Action items**:
- Consult a trademark attorney for a clearance opinion
- Consider filing a trademark application in Classes 9 and 42 specifically for QA testing tools
- Using "Prowl" or "prowl" as the primary brand provides stronger differentiation

**Status (2026-09-01, {PROWL-077} review)**: kept High — legal de-risk that should land
before the {PROWL-078} distribution push invests further in the brand.

{PROWL-079} **REL-002: Organization signing chain for `prowl-macdriver` releases (release gate)**
   The macdriver release automation ({PROWL-052}) is merged and ready, but going live is
   blocked on a signing identity: release binaries must be signed with a **Developer ID
   certificate issued to the organization**, so the signature — publicly inspectable via
   `codesign -dvv` on every distributed copy — carries the organization's name. Signing with
   an individual-account certificate is ruled out by the project's publishing policy. An
   Apple Developer **organization** enrollment has its own prerequisite chain, which is the
   real work of this item.

**Found during**: macdriver-distribution release planning (2026-09-01)
**Status (2026-09-11)**: organization verified with Apple Business, and the Apple Developer
Program **organization enrollment is submitted and awaiting Apple's review** (expect a
verification call to the business phone; annual fee is paid after approval). Repo side is
fully staged: both version pins are `0.1.0` and the release workflow is merged — once
enrollment completes, the remaining steps are cert + API key, the six secrets, and the
`macdriver-v0.1.0` tag.
**Prerequisite chain / Acceptance Criteria** (in order):
- Legal entity for the organization confirmed/registered (Apple rejects sole proprietorships/DBAs for org accounts)
- D-U-N-S number for the entity (free via Dun & Bradstreet, ~days; requires a business contact phone)
- Business phone number (a VoIP number may pass Apple's verification call; fallback is a low-cost real-SIM line) — the current sticking point
- Apple Developer Program organization enrollment ($99/yr; includes a verification call; days-to-weeks)
- Developer ID Application certificate + App Store Connect API key created under the org account
- The six repo secrets provisioned per `macdriver/RELEASING.md`
- Tag `macdriver-v0.1.0` → workflow green with notarization `status: Accepted` → live-verify `prowl macdriver install`
- Blocks {PROWL-074} completion and therefore {PROWL-076}/{PROWL-078}

{PROWL-037} **GTM-002: Competitive Positioning Matrix**
   Sharpen the comparison table on prowl.tools beyond feature checkmarks. Define what Prowl uniquely does better than Playwright Test, Cypress, Maestro, and Selenium — and be honest about where it's weaker. Current comparison table exists but isn't grounded in user feedback or win/loss data.

**Found during**: Gap analysis (2026-02-16)
**Status (2026-09-01, {PROWL-077} review)**: promoted Medium → High — the comparison page is
a named deliverable of the {PROWL-078} distribution sprint and can be drafted now, ahead of
the release gate ({PROWL-079}).
**Practitioner pain points to ground it in** (Reddit thread research, 2026-08-16 — real language
from Appium/Espresso/Maestro users; use these verbatim-ish, they beat feature checkmarks):
- *"Flakiness drives me up the wall … debugging timing crap or CI fails that work fine locally"*
  (Appium) → Prowl's answers: Playwright auto-waiting, deterministic scripted steps, flake
  scoring/quarantine ({PROWL-035}), pinned container image ({PROWL-042}) for CI/local parity.
  Be honest: the macOS target is black-box AX (no in-process idle signal à la Espresso).
- *"Reliable and quick, but Android-only, and the boilerplate is a slog"* (Espresso) → hunts are
  ~a dozen lines, no instrumentation build; platform coverage is web + experimental macOS.
- *"YAML starts feeling like a cage when I need more control"* (Maestro) → Prowl's escape
  hatches: `runHunt` composition, `if`/`repeat`, runtime vars, `evalScript`/`runScript`, and the
  **library API** for graduating gnarly flows to TS (docs path tracked in prowl-docs PQD-005).
- *"No IDs or anything useful"* → stable-selector philosophy + `prowl analyze` selector ranking
  (macOS analog tracked as {PROWL-055}).
- The poster's wish list (MCP-native, AI-assisted, local/BYOK, no lock-in) is Prowl's mission
  statement — lead with it.
**Deliverable**: Updated comparison page with:
- "Best for" statement per competitor
- Prowl's unique angle (YAML simplicity + agent-native + Playwright power)
- Honest "not for you if..." section
- Testimonial placeholders for when early users provide feedback

## Medium Priority

{PROWL-011} **LEGAL-002: Add Dependency License Audit to CI**
   All direct dependencies are confirmed clean — MIT (commander, chalk, zod, ora), ISC (yaml), BSD-2-Clause (dotenv), Apache 2.0 (playwright, typescript). However, transitive dependencies can introduce GPL-licensed packages. Research shows 7.3% of npm packages have license incompatibilities through transitive deps.

**Action**: Add `license-checker` to CI pipeline:
```bash
npx license-checker --summary --exclude 'MIT,ISC,Apache-2.0,BSD-2-Clause,BSD-3-Clause'
```

---

{PROWL-017} **P4-006: `waitForResponse` Step Type**
   Wait for a specific network response before continuing. More precise than `waitForNetworkIdle`.

```yaml
- waitForResponse:
    url: "**/api/orders"
    status: 200
    timeout: 10000
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `waitForResponse: { url: string, status?: number, timeout?: number }`
- URL supports glob/substring matching
- Optional status filter (only resolve when response matches status)
- Playwright: `page.waitForResponse()`
- Schema validation, unit tests

{PROWL-027} **P6-005: Video Recording**
   Record full hunt execution as MP4 video.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Config option: `artifacts.video: true` (default: false)
- CLI flag: `prowl run homepage --video`
- Playwright: `browser.newContext({ recordVideo: { dir: ... } })`, then `context.newPage()` for pages; `recordVideo` is a browser context option, not a page option
- Video saved to run directory alongside screenshots
- Useful for sharing failures with non-technical stakeholders

{PROWL-029} **P6-009: Persona-Specific Onboarding Paths**
   `prowl init` currently gives everyone the same 8 example hunts. Different users need different starting points. A solo developer testing a side project, a QA team adding regression tests, and an AI agent builder integrating Prowl all have different first-run needs.

**Found during**: Gap analysis (2026-02-16)
**Partial progress (2026-02-17; updated 2026-08-26)**: `prowl init` simplified from 8 example hunts to a lean starter set (`hello.yml` + `login-flow.yml`). The community hub has been retired, so starters ship in the CLI and curated worked examples live in the docs site — there is no hub and no CLI template registry. Remaining: preset-based onboarding paths (`--preset solo|team|ci|agent`).
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `prowl init` prompts for use case (or accepts `--preset`): `solo`, `team`, `ci`, `agent`
- Each preset generates tailored example hunts, config, and README hints
- `solo`: minimal config, 2 simple example hunts, quick-start focus
- `team`: full config with common guardrails, example hunts for auth/CRUD/forms
- `ci`: config with `artifacts.junit: true`, GitHub Actions workflow template, CI-ready examples
- `agent`: config with `--json` examples, library API usage guide, `.env` template for secrets
- Existing behavior preserved as default when no preset is selected

{PROWL-033} **P7-003: Retry Diagnostics**
   When a hunt uses `retry` and eventually passes, capture diagnostic information about what failed and why the retry succeeded. Currently retries happen silently — the report only shows the final attempt.

**Found during**: Gap analysis (2026-02-16)
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `result.json` includes `retryHistory` array with per-attempt results when retries are used
- Each attempt records: status, failed step, error message, duration
- Summary report shows "Passed on attempt 2 of 3" with first-attempt failure reason
- `prowl history` shows retry frequency per hunt over time
- Helps distinguish "flaky test" from "slow environment" from "real regression"

## Low Priority

{PROWL-003} **P2-008: `prowl ci --fail-fast` Option**
   Add a `--fail-fast` flag to `prowl ci` that exits on the first hunt failure instead of running all hunts. Useful in CI pipelines where fast feedback is preferred over completeness.

**Found during**: Code review of P2-001 (2026-02-15)
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `prowl ci --fail-fast` stops after first failed hunt
- Summary still printed for completed + skipped hunts
- `ci-result.json` reflects partial run
- Remaining hunts marked as "skipped" in results

{PROWL-004} **P2-009: `prowl ci --output` and `--json` Flags**
   Add `--output <path>` flag to control where `ci-result.json` is written (for CI artifact upload), and `--json` flag for machine-readable stdout output (matching `prowl list --json` pattern).

**Found during**: Code review of P2-001 (2026-02-15)
**Status**: Partially complete — `--json` done (library-api branch), `--output` deferred
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ~~`prowl ci --json` emits the `CiResult` JSON to stdout instead of the formatted summary~~ ✓
- ~~Unit tests for `--json`~~ ✓
- `prowl ci --output ./results/` writes `ci-result.json` to specified directory (deferred)
- Both flags can be combined (deferred)

{PROWL-005} **P2-007: Slack/Webhook Notifications**
   Post results to external services on hunt failure.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Config option: `reporting.webhook.url` — POST JSON results to webhook on failure
- Config option: `reporting.slack.webhook` — formatted Slack message
- Include: hunt name, status, failure reason, link to artifacts
- Unit tests for webhook payload formatting

---

{PROWL-013} **LEGAL-004: Competitive Marketing Guidelines**
   Referencing Maestro and other competitors in documentation and marketing is legal when following FTC comparative advertising guidelines. All comparative claims must be truthful, non-deceptive, and verifiable.

**Guidelines**:
- Use competitor trademarks accurately (correct spelling, capitalization)
- Clearly identify competitors as separate products (no implied endorsement or affiliation)
- Only make factual, verifiable claims in comparison tables
- Use language like "compared to" or "alternative to" rather than disparaging language
- Include disclaimers like "Maestro is a trademark of mobile-dev-inc" where appropriate

{PROWL-018} **P4-007: Geolocation Simulation**
   Simulate geographic location for location-dependent web features.

**Maestro equivalent**: `setLocation`

```yaml
# In config.yml
browser:
  geolocation:
    latitude: 25.7617
    longitude: -80.1918

# Or as a step
- setGeolocation:
    latitude: 25.7617
    longitude: -80.1918
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Config option: `browser.geolocation: { latitude: number, longitude: number }`
- Step type: `setGeolocation: { latitude: number, longitude: number }`
- Playwright: `context.grantPermissions(['geolocation'])` + `context.setGeolocation()`
- Schema validation, unit tests

{PROWL-019} **P4-008: `doubleClick` and `rightClick` Step Types**
   Additional click variants for web-specific interactions (text selection, context menus).

```yaml
- doubleClick:
    selector: ".editable-text"
- rightClick:
    selector: ".context-menu-trigger"
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `doubleClick: { selector: string }` — Playwright `dblclick()`
- `rightClick: { selector: string }` — Playwright `click({ button: 'right' })`
- Forbidden selector checks
- Schema validation, unit tests

---

{PROWL-030} **P6-007: Hunt Dependency Graph**
   Define execution order dependencies between hunts for `prowl ci`.

```yaml
name: edit-order
dependsOn: ["create-order"]
steps:
  - navigate: "/orders"
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `dependsOn` field in hunt YAML: string array of hunt names
- `prowl ci` resolves dependency order (topological sort)
- If a dependency fails, skip dependent hunts (mark as "skipped" in report)
- Circular dependency detection → error
- Schema validation, unit tests

---

{PROWL-035} **P7-005: Flake Auto-Quarantine**
   Automatically quarantine hunts that exceed the flaky threshold so they don't block CI pipelines. Quarantined hunts still run but their failures don't affect the exit code.

**Found during**: Gap analysis (2026-02-16)
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Config option: `reliability.quarantine: true` (default: false)
- Hunts exceeding `flakyThreshold` over last N runs are auto-quarantined
- Quarantined hunts run with status reported as `"quarantined"` instead of `"fail"`
- Quarantined hunt failures don't affect `prowl ci` exit code
- CI summary clearly marks quarantined hunts
- `prowl flaky --quarantined` lists currently quarantined hunts
- Manual override: `quarantine: false` in hunt YAML to opt out

---

{PROWL-038} **GTM-003: Use-Case Landing Pages**
   Create targeted landing pages for each ICP segment rather than one generic homepage. A QA engineer searching "Playwright alternative" and an AI developer searching "programmatic browser testing" should land on different pages with different messaging.

**Found during**: Gap analysis (2026-02-16)
**Deliverable**: 2-3 landing page variants on prowl.tools:
- `/for/qa-teams` — regression testing, CI integration, reporting focus
- `/for/developers` — quick setup, YAML simplicity, local-first focus
- `/for/ai-agents` — JSON output, library API, programmatic integration focus

## Parked — behind the first-ten-human-users gate

Breadth items parked by the {PROWL-077} beachhead review (2026-09-01): none of these help a
Mac or web developer *try* Prowl in the next 60 days. They keep their numbers and re-enter
scheduling only after {PROWL-078}'s success metric (ten humans who ran a hunt) is met.

{PROWL-024} **P6-001: VS Code Extension (PARKED)**
   VS Code extension for Prowl hunt authoring and execution.

**Maestro equivalent**: Maestro Workbench + Maestro Assistant

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- YAML syntax highlighting for `.prowl/hunts/*.yml` with Prowl schema awareness
- IntelliSense/autocomplete for step types, assertion types, config options
- Run hunt from editor (right-click → "Run Hunt" or CodeLens above hunt name)
- View results inline (pass/fail badges, screenshot previews in hover)
- Go-to-definition for `runHunt` references
- Publish to VS Code Marketplace

{PROWL-025} **P6-002: `prowl studio` — Interactive Test Builder (PARKED)**
   Open a browser alongside a terminal UI. Click elements to generate YAML steps. See selectors on hover. Export to hunt file.

**Maestro equivalent**: Maestro Studio Desktop

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `prowl studio` opens target URL in headed browser with inspector overlay
- Clicking elements generates YAML step (click/fill/etc.) in terminal or output file
- Hovering shows available selectors for each element
- Export accumulated steps to `.prowl/hunts/<name>.yml`
- Support for recording fill values (prompt user for input)

## macOS Target — Phase 2 (Epic)

Follow-ups to the experimental macOS native target ({PROWL-048}, shipped 2026-08-15 on `main`,
unreleased). Priorities should be re-ordered by dogfood feedback from the first real consumer
(Sentwise menu bar app, `prowl-hunts` branch in that repo). Phase 1 scope notes live in
`resolved.md` under PROWL-048.

**Epic status (2026-09-10, {PROWL-056} code-complete on branch): ACTIVE** — the core beachhead
epic. {PROWL-056} is pending PR merge and release. The remaining epic item, {PROWL-052}
(helper distribution), is code-complete and owner-gated: its go-live waits on {PROWL-079}. No
open code items remain in this epic.

{PROWL-052} **ARCH-006: Distribute the `prowl-macdriver` helper**
   The macOS target currently requires a source checkout and local `swift build`. Ship the
helper so npm users can use the target: prebuilt universal binary attached to GitHub Releases
with an install/download command (`prowl doctor --fix`-style), and/or a Homebrew formula in
`prowl-tools/homebrew-tap`. Keep the npm tarball JS-only.

**Found during**: PROWL-048 phase-1 scope notes (2026-08-15)
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- A supported install path that doesn't require Xcode on the user's machine
- Signed/notarized binary (or documented Gatekeeper workaround) — coordinate with the Sentwise release-automation learnings
- `resolveHelperBinary` search order documented and extended (user-level install location)
- CI recipe for macOS runners updated

**Status (2026-08-31, branch `macdriver-distribution`)**: automation shipped, not
yet live. Delivered: `prowl macdriver install` (raw-fetch download from GitHub
Releases + SHA-256 verify + codesign check, installs to
`~/.prowl/macdriver/<version>/`), `prowl macdriver status`, the pinned
`MACDRIVER_VERSION` (`src/browser/macdriver-release.ts`), the extended
`resolveHelperBinary` order (env → user-install → source build, documented in
code + README), and the tag-triggered `.github/workflows/macdriver-release.yml`
(build → lipo universal → codesign → notarize → checksum → GitHub Release). npm
tarball stays JS-only. **Remains (owner)**: provision the signing secrets
(`macdriver/RELEASING.md`), cut the first `macdriver-v0.1.0` release, and confirm
a notarized binary installs cleanly — until then `install` 404s by design.
Homebrew formula for the helper not pursued (npm install path covers it). The
signing-identity prerequisite chain is tracked as {PROWL-079}.


## Mobile Target (Epic)

Add Android and iOS as first-class Prowl targets, extending the `SessionDriver` abstraction the
same way the macOS target did. Motivation (competitive research, 2026-08-18): Maestro owns the
"simple YAML mobile testing" mindshare; BrowserStack's App Automate runs Maestro suites as a
first-class framework, which means mobile YAML runners are now cloud-portable — Prowl without a
mobile target concedes that whole segment. Architecture decision from the research spike:
**"Maestro-shaped, Appium-parts"** — no Appium server, no JVM, no gRPC. Each platform gets a
thin driver that shells out for device lifecycle and speaks plain HTTP/JSON (raw `fetch`, per
the `ai.ts` no-heavy-SDKs ethos) to a battle-tested, Apache-2.0, standalone on-device agent
maintained by the Appium project. This mirrors the macdriver pattern exactly (external helper +
JSON protocol) and beats Maestro's own implementation on two known weaknesses: no JVM
dependency, and dynamically allocated ports so parallel sessions/CI jobs work from day one.
Build order: **PROWL-058 (Android) first** — Linux CI story is cheapest and real devices come
free via adb — then PROWL-059 (iOS simulator), then PROWL-060/061. **PROWL-062 (real iOS
devices) is intentionally deferred** — code signing, Developer Mode, and iOS 17+ tunnels are the
swamp that has kept even Maestro from shipping it; revisit with `go-ios` as the enabler.

**Epic status (2026-09-01, {PROWL-077} review; updated 2026-09-05): FROZEN (experimental)** —
Android and iOS-simulator support shipped and stays maintained, but no new scope until a real
user asks; {PROWL-062} remains deferred. The one admitted exception, {PROWL-080} (mobile
scroll/swipe — the owner hit the gap dogfooding the iOS Simulator target, the epic's documented
unfreeze condition), **shipped 2026-09-05** (see `docs/resolved.md`); the epic is frozen again,
with an explicit `swipe` step noted there as a deferred follow-up should a user ask.

{PROWL-062} **ARCH-012: Real iOS device support (DEFERRED — do not start)**
   Code signing of the WDA runner, Developer Mode enrollment, and iOS 17+ CoreDevice tunnels
make this a separate epic. `go-ios` (MIT) is the most credible enabler (installs/runs WDA and
manages tunnels without Xcode, even from Linux). Parked until PROWL-058/059 ship and a real
user asks; note Android real devices already work via {PROWL-058}.

**Found during**: BrowserStack/mobile competitive research (2026-08-18)

## Commercialization — Prowl Cloud (Epic)

Turn Prowl into a sellable product without abandoning the mission. Model decision (owner,
2026-08-18, grounded in Maestro/Cypress/Sentry/Momentic monetization research): **open-core**.
The CLI stays Apache-2.0 and free forever for local/self-hosted CI use; revenue comes from
**convenience layers**, in this order: (1) **managed AI metered by credits** — AI features work
with a Prowl account and no API key, routed through our provider keys with margin (the Momentic
pattern); (2) **hosted results/team dashboards** — execution stays on the user's machines, we
host history/trends/sharing (the Cypress Cloud pattern). **Standing guarantees, not up for
re-litigation per item:** BYOK remains a supported free path forever (we invert Maestro's
BYOK-removal, which now forces an account even for local AI); no existing local feature is ever
paywalled retroactively; **no hosted device-execution farm** (explicit non-goal — capital-heavy,
commoditized under open runners; partner/integrate instead if demanded). Design the paid layer
so the value is the *service* (AI quality, dashboards, support), not a gateable API — Cypress's
dashboard-blocking backlash and Maestro's discount resellers (DeviceCloud, Moropo) are the
cautionary tales. Server-side components will live in a new repo (working name `prowl-cloud`);
this epic tracks the CLI-side work and the overall sequencing. Build order: **BIZ-001 →
BIZ-002 → BIZ-003**, with BIZ-004 as the second act and BIZ-005 alongside first paid launch.

**Epic status (2026-09-01, {PROWL-077} review): PARKED — gated on the first ten human users.**
No BIZ item is scheduled until ten real humans have run a hunt ({PROWL-078}'s metric). The
model decision and standing guarantees above are unchanged and apply when the epic reopens.

{PROWL-063} **BIZ-001: Prowl account + CLI auth (`prowl login`)**
   *As a user, I want to sign in from the CLI so AI features can work without me managing an API
key.*
   Foundation for everything paid: account service, `prowl login` / `prowl logout` /
`PROWL_API_KEY` env for CI, token storage outside the repo, `prowl whoami`. Anonymous use of
everything that works today must remain untouched — auth is only consulted by features that
need the cloud.

**Found during**: Commercialization decision (2026-08-18)
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `prowl login` (browser/device-code flow) and `PROWL_API_KEY` for headless CI
- Credentials stored user-level (never in `.prowl/` or the repo); redacted from all artifacts
- No existing command's behavior changes when logged out
- Server counterpart tracked in the `prowl-cloud` repo once created

{PROWL-064} **BIZ-002: Managed AI proxy with credit metering**
   *As a user, I want AI-powered features to just work on my Prowl account, and as the owner, I
want each AI call metered in credits with margin.*
   A thin hosted endpoint in front of the existing raw-`fetch` provider abstraction
(`src/generator/ai.ts`): CLI sends the same provider-shaped requests to our proxy when no BYOK
key is configured; proxy authenticates the account, routes to a provider with our keys, meters
credits, bills via Stripe. Free monthly credit allowance for the funnel; BYOK bypasses the
proxy entirely (user pays their provider directly, we never see the traffic).

**Found during**: Commercialization decision (2026-08-18)
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Resolution order documented and tested: explicit BYOK key → managed proxy (logged in) →
  actionable error naming both options
- Credit metering + Stripe billing on the server side; CLI surfaces remaining credits and a
  clear out-of-credits error (never a silent failure or a hung hunt)
- No request/response content retained server-side beyond what billing requires — privacy
  posture documented (this is the trust story; it must be true)
- Depends on {PROWL-063}

{PROWL-065} **BIZ-003: Dual-path AI feature set (first consumers)**
   Ship the AI features that make BIZ-002 worth paying for, each working identically via BYOK or
managed credits: `assertWithAI` ({PROWL-020}) as the first consumer, then AI hunt generation
(natural language → hunt YAML, leaning on `prowl analyze` output for grounded selectors) and
AI selector-repair suggestions on failure (suggest-only in reports — never silent self-healing;
determinism is the product).

**Found during**: Commercialization decision (2026-08-18)
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- {PROWL-020} implemented with the BIZ-002 resolution order
- `prowl generate` (or similar): prompt + analyze snapshot → draft hunt YAML for human review
- Failed-selector suggestions appear in the run report as proposals, never auto-applied
- Every feature degrades gracefully with neither key nor account (skip/warn, never break runs)
- Depends on {PROWL-064}

{PROWL-066} **BIZ-004: Hosted results console (`prowl push`)**
   *As a team, we want shared run history, flake trends, and failure artifacts without standing
up our own storage.*
   Opt-in upload of the existing file-based artifacts (`result.json`, junit, screenshots,
traces) to a hosted console: history per hunt, flake scoring over time, shareable failure
links, PR annotations. Execution never moves to the cloud — this monetizes visibility, not
infra. Supersedes/absorbs the "hosted report ingestion" line inside {PROWL-046} for
non-enterprise users.

**Found during**: Commercialization decision (2026-08-18)
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `prowl push` (and `prowl ci --push`) uploads a run's artifacts under the account's project
- Console: run list, per-hunt history/trends, artifact viewing, shareable links
- Team seats/roles at minimum viable level; data export + delete (self-sovereignty guarantee —
  leaving must be easy and complete)
- Depends on {PROWL-063}; independent of BIZ-002/003

{PROWL-067} **BIZ-005: Pricing, packaging & site launch**
   Decide and publish the tiers (working hypothesis: Free = full CLI + BYOK + free credit
allowance; Pro = credit bundle + hosted console; Team/Enterprise later), update `prowl.tools`
with honest pricing and the "never locked in" guarantee stated as policy, and update docs.
Coordinate with {PROWL-037} (positioning matrix) so the anti-metered-lock-in message and the
paid tiers don't contradict each other — the line is: we charge for convenience, never for
your data or your exit.

**Found during**: Commercialization decision (2026-08-18)
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Pricing page live with real numbers; free tier limits stated plainly (no surprise-renewal
  dark patterns — the BrowserStack Trustpilot file is the anti-pattern)
- Docs cover BYOK vs managed paths side by side
- CHANGELOG/README updated when the first paid feature ships

## CI/CD & OpenShift (Epic)

Make Prowl usable as an automated go/no-go acceptance gate in CI/CD pipelines and OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton), in addition to its original manual/exploratory use. The CLI already has the runtime primitives (`prowl ci` with exit codes 0/1/2, `--json`, `--junit`, `--url`, `--parallel`); the missing piece is packaging/distribution, not core behavior. Positioning: an **agent-friendly acceptance/smoke layer** ("plain-English end-to-end checks that protect deploys"), **not** a replacement for unit/integration suites. Build order: **CICD-001 first** (shared dependency), then 002/003/004 in parallel as desired; **CICD-005 (Operator/enterprise) is intentionally last and large — do not start it before 001–004 ship.** Everything here is additive/opt-in; users not doing CI/CD are unaffected.

**Epic status (2026-09-01, {PROWL-077} review): PARKED — gated on the first ten human users.**
The CLI-side runtime primitives already shipped; the packaging items (CICD-001..005,
{PROWL-068}) wait until real users exist to consume them.

{PROWL-042} **CICD-001: Publish a `prowl` container image**
   *As a platform/devops user, I want a ready-to-run Prowl container so I can run hunts in CI without installing Node, the CLI, and Playwright browsers myself.*
   Foundation for the rest of the epic — both generic CI and OpenShift need a prebuilt image bundling Node + Prowl + Chromium + Playwright system libs.

**Found during**: CI/CD + OpenShift feasibility review (2026-05-30, Red Hat SA conversation)
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Dockerfile: Node 20 base, Prowl installed (global or built `dist`), Chromium + Playwright system dependencies, pinned Playwright/Chromium versions
- `docker run --rm <image> prowl ci --url <target> --json` runs a suite end-to-end and exits with the correct code (0/1/2)
- **Non-root UID run check**: image runs and Chromium launches when started as an arbitrary non-root user (de-risks OpenShift's restricted SCC early)
- Published to a registry (GHCR and/or Docker Hub) with documented tags
- Shared dependency for CICD-003, CICD-004, CICD-005

{PROWL-043} **CICD-002: Generic CI/CD usage docs + sample pipelines**
   *As a developer, I want copy-paste CI examples so I can wire `prowl ci` in as a deploy gate without figuring out the plumbing.*
   Documentation + samples only; no runtime change.

**Found during**: CI/CD + OpenShift feasibility review (2026-05-30)
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- README + prowl-docs section: run `prowl ci` as a deploy go/no-go gate, framed as an acceptance/smoke layer (not a replacement for unit/integration tests)
- Ready-to-copy GitHub Actions and GitLab CI examples using the CICD-001 image
- Document how exit codes (0 pass / 1 fail / 2 no-hunts|all-skipped) gate the build
- Document publishing `junit.xml` and `.prowl/runs/` artifacts from the pipeline
- Document injecting `--url` (staging/preview targets) and secrets via `{{VAR}}` interpolation
- Depends on CICD-001

{PROWL-044} **CICD-003: Tekton Task + OpenShift Pipelines example**
   *As an OpenShift user, I want a Tekton Task that runs Prowl so I can gate promotion on real browser acceptance checks.*

**Found during**: CI/CD + OpenShift feasibility review (2026-05-30)
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- A Tekton `Task` (plus a sample `Pipeline`) that runs the CICD-001 image
- Params for target URL and config path
- Runs `prowl ci`; exits non-zero on failure to gate promotion
- Stores artifacts (`.prowl/runs/`, junit.xml) to a workspace/PVC
- Docs: "Run Prowl in OpenShift Pipelines"
- Depends on CICD-001

{PROWL-045} **CICD-004: OpenShift compatibility hardening + docs**
   *As an enterprise OpenShift user, I want Prowl to run under the restricted SCC so it works in a locked-down cluster.*
   The item that makes the enterprise claim real. **Confirmed gap:** `launchBrowser` (`src/browser/controller.ts:30-34`) calls `engine.launch({ headless, slowMo, channel })` with no `args`, so there is no `--no-sandbox` hook — Chromium under OpenShift's restricted SCC will likely need one. This is the only place in the epic that touches `src/`.

**Found during**: CI/CD + OpenShift feasibility review (2026-05-30)
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Image runs rootless / SCC `restricted-v2` compatible
- Add a config/guardrail-gated browser launch-args option (e.g. opt-in `--no-sandbox`) — **opt-in only, never a default**, since it's a security trade-off; local `prowl run`/`ci` behavior unchanged
- Document secrets / `auth-state.json` injection for pipeline use
- Document artifact persistence (workspace/PVC)
- Schema validation + unit tests for the new launch-args option
- Depends on CICD-001

{PROWL-068} **CICD-007: Prowl GitHub App — branded check runs on PRs**
   *As a repo owner running Prowl in CI, I want the Prowl check on my PRs to carry the Prowl
name and logo (like CodeRabbit/Codecov) instead of the generic GitHub Actions octocat.*
   The avatar on a PR check row belongs to the GitHub App that created the check, so this
requires a first-party **"Prowl" GitHub App** (owned by the `prowltools` account, Prowl logo as
avatar, `checks: write` permission) publishing a check run via the Checks API. The Actions
workflow mints an app token (`actions/create-github-app-token`) and posts a check named
"Prowl" whose summary is rendered from `ci-result.json` (pass/fail counts, failed hunts,
artifact pointers); consumers mark *that* check as required. Beyond cosmetics this is a
distribution surface — per-hunt PR annotations now, links into the hosted results console
({PROWL-066}) later.

**Found during**: Sentwise CI dogfooding (2026-08-18 — PR checks showed octocat + stale
"Prowl QA" naming)
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- App creation is a documented manual step for the repo owner (name "Prowl", logo upload,
  `checks: write`, install on target repos); no app credentials ever committed
- A rendering path from `ci-result.json` to check-run `output` (title/summary/failed-hunt
  detail) — either a documented `gh api` recipe or a small `prowl` helper subcommand; failed
  hunts listed with their failure step, capped sensibly
- Check conclusion mirrors `prowl ci` exit semantics (0 → success, 1 → failure, 2 → neutral)
- Copy-paste workflow snippet in docs (prowl-docs CI section, cross-repo duty)
- First consumer: Sentwise's `prowl-qa.yml` adopts it, the branded check becomes the required
  one, and the workflow/job is renamed from the retired "Prowl QA" branding to "Prowl"
- Optional stretch: per-hunt check-run annotations on the changed files

{PROWL-046} **CICD-005: Enterprise productization (LARGE — do last)**
   *As a Red Hat / enterprise customer, I want a certified, governed Prowl distribution integrated with the OpenShift Console.*
   Captured per full-scope decision, but **do not start before CICD-001–004 ship** — building an Operator first is overkill (per the Red Hat SA's own advice). Will likely split into sub-items when picked up.

**Found during**: CI/CD + OpenShift feasibility review (2026-05-30)
**Acceptance Criteria** (high-level; to be decomposed later):
- Operator or certified/operator-style distribution
- OpenShift Console integration
- Dashboards for run results/trends
- Multi-project governance + RBAC/policy templates
- Hosted report ingestion
- Explicitly blocked on CICD-001 through CICD-004

## Sunset Work Items

Context (2026-08-26): Prowl Hub and Prowl Infra Hub are being retired and prowl-review moves to
maintenance mode as a personal tool. **The CLI is now the single product**, and the intended
beachhead is **desktop-first (macOS native apps, incl. menu-bar extras) with web as the second
target** — the one position no incumbent holds (Maestro: mobile/web; Playwright: web; XCUITest:
Swift/Xcode). These items capture what lands on this repo from that decision; they are meant
to be re-evaluated against the epics above (in particular, the Commercialization / Prowl Cloud
and CI/CD & OpenShift epics should be re-prioritised against the beachhead) before being
scheduled. **That re-evaluation ({PROWL-077}) was completed 2026-09-01** — decisions are
recorded on each epic header and on the affected items' status lines.

{PROWL-072} **SUNSET-001: Lean starter hunts in `prowl init` + curated docs examples (Hub replacement)**
   With the community hub retired, do NOT rebuild a template registry inside the CLI — no
   `prowl init --template`, no `prowl templates list`, no importing the full hub set (that would
   just re-bloat the tool). Instead keep `prowl init` seeded with a small, high-value starter set
   (currently `hello.yml` + `login-flow.yml`; optionally add one form example and a macOS one so
   the desktop story has a starter), and publish a curated handful of worked examples on the docs
   site for readers to copy. The rest of the old hub hunts are archived with the hub, not carried
   into the CLI or the tarball.
   **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - `prowl init` scaffolds a lean starter set (smoke + auth at minimum); no `--template`/registry surface
   - A curated examples set lives in the docs (prowl-docs), not a hub or the tarball
   - No dependency on `prowl-hub`; CHANGELOG entry for any init-starter change
   - In progress: `login-flow.yml` starter added on branch `init-login-starter`

{PROWL-074} **SUNSET-003: Make the macOS target a two-minute install (gate for distribution)**
   A stranger cannot use the macOS target today: the Swift helper is not in the npm tarball,
   requires a source checkout + Xcode toolchain + `swift build`, then Accessibility and Screen
   Recording permissions. This is the single biggest blocker to the desktop-first positioning.
   **This item does not duplicate PROWL-052 (ARCH-006, distribute `prowl-macdriver`)** — it
   promotes ARCH-006 to the top of the queue and adds the end-to-end onboarding on top of it:
   `npm i -g prowl-tools && prowl init --target macos` fetches/locates the signed helper, and
   `prowl doctor` (or `init`) walks the user through granting TCC permissions with a clear
   pass/fail.
   **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - ARCH-006 shipped (prebuilt, signed/notarized universal binary, checksum-verified)
   - Fresh machine → first green macOS hunt in under five minutes with no source checkout
   - Docs: `prowl-docs` PQD-009

   **Status (2026-08-31, branch `macdriver-distribution`)**: CLI/onboarding half
   shipped on top of the PROWL-052 automation. Delivered: `prowl macdriver
   install` as the primary, no-Xcode setup path; `prowl macdriver status` for the
   resolved-binary/versions/TCC-permission walkthrough (kept scoped to the
   macdriver — the general `prowl doctor` stays PROWL-026); README macOS section
   rewritten install-first. **Remains (owner)**: the live steps that can't be run
   here — provision signing secrets, cut the first `macdriver-v*` release, and
   time the fresh-machine `npm i -g prowl-tools && prowl macdriver install` flow
   under five minutes; then relabel the macOS target experimental → beta
   (PROWL-075). `prowl-docs` PQD-009 is a separate-repo follow-up. Item stays open
   until the owner verifies the live install. The signing-identity prerequisite
   chain is tracked as {PROWL-079}.

{PROWL-076} **SUNSET-005: Publish the "macOS app E2E in CI" recipe (dogfood write-up)**
   The owner already runs macOS-app hunts in CI on real projects. Getting Accessibility
   permission on a runner is exactly where everyone gets stuck; however it was solved
   (self-hosted runner, pre-granted TCC, etc.) is the first piece of distribution content and
   the most credible proof the target is production-ready. Write it as a docs guide (`prowl-docs`
   PQD-009) and a blog post on prowl.tools, with a ≤20-line hunt and the workflow file.
   **Acceptance Criteria**: guide + post published; a reader can reproduce the CI setup from
   the text alone (no private-runbook dependency).

{PROWL-078} **SUNSET-007: 60-day macOS-beachhead distribution sprint (success metric: humans)**
   Zero organic users after seven months means the constraint is reach, not features.
   Time-box a distribution window after PROWL-074/075/076 ship: the CI recipe post
   (PROWL-076), a ≤60-second demo of a menu-bar app being tested (repurpose the local
   `prowl-review-video` Remotion prototype for the CLI), a comparison page vs. Maestro /
   Playwright / XCUITest, and direct outreach to indie Mac developers (Sparkle/Homebrew
   ecosystem, Mac dev communities). Track **humans who ran a hunt**, not npm downloads
   (release-week spikes are mirrors). Feeds GTM-002/GTM-003.
   **Acceptance Criteria**: window dated and closed with a count of real users and a written
   keep/pivot decision; ten conversations with people who write E2E tests for Mac or web apps.
