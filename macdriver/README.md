# prowl-macdriver (experimental)

`prowl-macdriver` is the Accessibility (AXUIElement) helper binary behind Prowl's
**experimental** macOS execution target (PROWL-048 / ARCH-002). Prowl's
TypeScript `MacDriver` spawns it in `serve` mode and drives a native macOS app —
including menu bar extras (`NSStatusItem` + `NSMenu`) — over newline-delimited
JSON on stdio.

> **Distribution.** This binary is **not** bundled in the npm tarball. End users
> install a prebuilt, signed, notarized universal build with
> `prowl macdriver install` (published via GitHub Releases by the
> `.github/workflows/macdriver-release.yml` workflow — see
> [RELEASING.md](./RELEASING.md)). Contributors build from source (below). The
> target is gated behind `target.type: "macos"` and is not on the default web
> path.

## Install (end users)

```bash
prowl macdriver install     # downloads + checksum-verifies the pinned signed build
prowl macdriver status      # shows the resolved binary, versions, and TCC guidance
```

## Build (contributors)

```bash
cd macdriver
swift build -c release        # binary at .build/release/prowl-macdriver
```

Prowl locates the binary via, in order:
1. `PROWL_MACDRIVER_BIN` (absolute path to the binary), then
2. the user-level install `~/.prowl/macdriver/<version>/prowl-macdriver`
   (what `prowl macdriver install` writes), then
3. the repo-local source build `macdriver/.build/release/prowl-macdriver`, then
   `macdriver/.build/debug/prowl-macdriver`.
If none exist, Prowl fails with a clear message pointing at
`prowl macdriver install` (source build as the contributor fallback) instead of
crashing.

## Version

The helper's own version line is `macdriverVersion` in
`Sources/prowl-macdriver/DriverCLI.swift`, printed by `prowl-macdriver version`.
It must match the CLI's pinned `MACDRIVER_VERSION`
(`src/browser/macdriver-release.ts`); bump both together when cutting a release.

## Accessibility permission

The **process that hosts** `prowl-macdriver` must be granted Accessibility
permission (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility). When Prowl is
launched from a terminal, macOS attributes the grant to that terminal app (e.g.
Terminal, iTerm, VS Code), not to `prowl-macdriver` itself.

Preflight from the command line:

```bash
.build/release/prowl-macdriver check   # prints {"trusted": <bool>}; prompts on first run
```

`screenshot` additionally needs Screen Recording permission for the hosting app.
It captures the attached app's **frontmost window** (via
`CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` → `screencapture -x -l <windowID>`) so baselines are
window-sized and stable across desktops and machines — a full-screen grab would
fold in the menu bar clock, wallpaper, and unrelated windows and make
`assertScreenshot` diffs flaky. Both the window enumeration (which only returns
window IDs with the grant) and the capture itself require Screen Recording. When
the app exposes no capturable window (menu-only apps, an open status-item menu,
everything minimized) it falls back to a full-screen capture and includes a
`warning` in the response rather than failing the shot.

## Protocol

`serve` reads one JSON request per line on stdin and writes one JSON response per
line on stdout. State (the attached app, open menus) persists across requests.

```text
→ {"id":1,"cmd":"launch","app":"com.example.App","timeout":10}
← {"id":1,"ok":true,"result":{"bundleId":"com.example.App","pid":1234}}
→ {"id":2,"cmd":"click","query":{"by":"role","role":"button","name":"Save"}}
← {"id":2,"ok":true,"result":{"clicked":true}}
```

Query shapes (parsed on the TypeScript side from Prowl's selector dialect):

| Selector | Query |
|---|---|
| `id=openSettings` | `{"by":"id","value":"openSettings"}` |
| `role=button[name="Save"]` | `{"by":"role","role":"button","name":"Save"}` |
| `label="Email"` | `{"by":"label","value":"Email"}` |
| bare text / `text="Save"` | `{"by":"text","value":"Save"}` |

Verbs: `check`, `launch`, `activate`, `quit`, `count`, `text`, `click`, `fill`,
`press` (Enter/Return/Space only), `hover`, `scrollTo`, `waitFor`, `screenshot`,
`statusItems`, `windows`, `openMenu`, `closeMenu`, `clickMenu`, `tree`,
`shutdown`.

### Server-initiated events (ARCH-008)

Alongside id-matched responses, `serve` may write **event lines**: a JSON object
with an `event` discriminant and **no `id`**. They are informational — a wait is
still resolved by its id-matched response — so a client routes them out-of-band
and never matches them against its pending-request map.

The event-driven waits (`waitFor` and menu-open detection in
`openMenu`/`clickMenu`) subscribe to the attached app's `AXObserver`
notifications and emit one event line per notification received during the wait:

```text
→ {"id":7,"cmd":"waitFor","query":{"by":"id","value":"ready"},"timeout":10}
← {"event":"axNotification","cmd":"waitFor","notification":"AXMenuOpened"}
← {"id":7,"ok":true,"result":{"found":true,"waitMode":"event"}}
```

Waits do one immediate check, then resolve the instant a notification shows the
predicate is satisfied, with a slow safety re-poll underneath. Each notification
registration is best-effort; when the app announces none, the wait degrades to
the classic 100ms poll and reports `"waitMode":"polling"`. The timeout is
unchanged — a wait that never resolves still errors at its deadline.

## Lineage

Promoted from the `spikes/macdriver/axspike` proof of concept, which validated
the core AX mechanism end-to-end against a real menu bar app: status-item
discovery via `AXExtrasMenuBar`, menu open/dump/click (`AXPress` with a short
messaging timeout to avoid blocking on the menu-tracking loop), window listing,
and the `AXIsProcessTrusted` preflight.
